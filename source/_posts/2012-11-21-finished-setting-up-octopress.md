## Knowing Octopress for a long time

I still remember the first time I saw a blog which is build on
Octopress, I was so impressed that this blog system is neat and great
for programmers. But it was built on Ruby, I just gave a thought and did
not continue to setup one for myself. Until today, I tried hard to
overcome a lot of wiered Ruby problem, and it is online now.

## Reason for choosing Octopress

There are many other guys wrote a lot of wonderful posts on this topics.
See
[Chico](http://oblita.com/blog/2012/07/06/octopress-with-mathjax-by-kramdown/)
for his reason and tutorial. Especially when you want to use beautiful math
expressions, read this. Other posts like
[akkunchoi](http://akkunchoi.github.com/jekyll-github-blogging.html) who
built his blog system on Jekyll which is the base system of Octopress.
Another guy [BluePlanet](http://blueplanet.github.com/blog/page/8/) moved from Jekyll to Octopress. [Shun Matsumoto](http://change-the-world.github.com/blog/2012/08/26/1/) also wrote a post in Japanese. If you'd like to read Japanese, it's a good post.

For me, the reason is simple.

1. Octopress support git to manage the history of posts
2. Octopress can be easily deployed to github, FREE
3. Octopress support using markdown to write my posts, which is much
   more fun than HTML or any other markup language

## What's next?

Just keep on updating my blogs and bring you high quality posts on
iOS/Mac/Web/HTML5 relates fields.

Bon Voyage!
